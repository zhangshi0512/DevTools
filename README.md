# DevTools Repository

Welcome to the DevTools repository! This collection of development tools is designed to facilitate various tasks related to document processing, image manipulation, and advanced retrieval and generative systems. Below is an overview of the main components within this repository.

## Setup

Before running the scripts in this repository, you may need to set up your environment and install necessary dependencies. Depending on the script, the requirements may vary, but here are some common steps to get started:

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system. These scripts are compatible with Python 3.6 and above. You can download Python from [the official website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

2. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/DevTools.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the repository directory:

   ```
   cd DevTools
   ```

4. It's recommended to use a virtual environment to manage your dependencies. Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

5. Install the required packages. The specific dependencies for each script are listed in their respective directories, typically in a file named `requirements.txt`. You can install these dependencies using pip:

   ```
   pip install -r path/to/requirements.txt
   ```

   For example, if you're planning to use the `document_process` tools, and there's a `requirements.txt` in that directory, you would run:

   ```
   pip install -r document_process/requirements.txt
   ```

6. Once the dependencies are installed, you're ready to run the scripts as per their usage instructions.

## Document Processing

- **PDF2TEXT.py**: A handy script for converting PDF documents into text format. This tool can be particularly useful for extracting readable text from scanned PDFs or digital documents that need to be processed or analyzed as text data.

## Image Processing

- **IMGCONVERTER.py**: A versatile image converter script that supports various image formats. Whether you need to batch convert images for a web project or adjust image formats for analysis, IMGCONVERTER.py provides a straightforward solution.

## RAG System

The RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System is a more complex suite within this repository, comprising several sub-components designed to work together in advanced document processing, information retrieval, and data generation tasks.

- **Generative Model**

  - `generate.py`: Part of the generative model component, this script is likely involved in generating text or data based on specific inputs or datasets.

- **Language Chain**

  - Language Chain utilities include scripts that facilitate the manipulation and processing of language data, potentially for tasks such as translation, summarization, or content generation.

- **PDF Processing**

  - Extends the capabilities of the document processing component with additional scripts dedicated to more nuanced PDF manipulation tasks.

- **Retrieval System**

  - Comprises tools for indexing and searching within large datasets or corpora. This component is crucial for systems that require efficient data retrieval capabilities, such as search engines or recommendation systems.

- **UI**
  - Contains scripts for a user interface, suggesting that the RAG system can be interacted with through a graphical interface, making it accessible for users who may not be comfortable working directly with command-line tools.

## Getting Started

After setting up your environment and installing the necessary dependencies, you can navigate to the component you're interested in and follow the specific usage instructions provided there.
